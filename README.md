Unity3D_Sprogget
================

A robot platformer game. Currently in very early development phase!

To see various documentation, go to the Documents folder. It includes
fun stuff like licensing information and the GDD (all still in very
early to non-existent writing phase).


TODO List
---------
Pretty much everything in the Documents folder
Stats Hud (health, lives, etc)
Take damage when falling or hitting something too fast
Wander AI with fall avoidance and maybe jumping ability
Better way to move platforms around (might be solved with iTween)
Way to save the game
 ->Need to also figure out how we want to allow the player to save
Double-jump
Powerups
 ->Faster, better jump, invincibility, no fall damage, double points
Defined Point System
